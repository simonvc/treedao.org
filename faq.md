# What is TreeDAO

TreeDAO is a distributed autonomous organization (DAO) that is raising ~100 ETH to buy a woodland. It will do this by issuing circa 5000 NFTs. 

These NFTs will represent aspects of the woodland, and take the form of a geotagged photo taken in the woodland after purchase. 

The NFTs will also have voting rights, 1 vote per NFT that will control how the DAO is run, and what happens to the woodland.

These NFTs will make ideal durable digital gifts. They will conform to NFT standards and be tradable on open platforms that support EIP 729 or 1155.

# Why an NFT + DAO?

There are aspects of NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) and aspects of Distributed Autonomous Organizations that we thing work really well together in this context. 

NFTs are digital goods, that can be easily tracked and make good and novel gifts. People already gift Fungible, Ephemeral things, for example, gift cards, cut flowers, or "donation certificates". Unlike these gifts, NFTs attached to real world objects have ongoing value. 

Recipients of a TreeDAO NFT, can use the voting power attached to the NFT, to have a say in how the woodlands are managed, and can vote to allow the DAO to raise more funding, and buy more woodlands. NFTs are also durable goods, and can be infinitely re-gifted, with the sender paying ETH gas fees. NFTs following EIP 1155 can be re-sold with a portion of the sale value returning to the DAO, to cover upkeep or expansion.

Finally, the DAO provides a way to guarantee the minimum value of the NFT.. If the NFTs traded at far below the sale price of the woodland, someone could acquire 51% of the tokens, and vote to sell the land and return the money back to the NFT holders. 

# Where is the woodland?

We are currently looking at a property just north of london, a short distance from the tube line. NFT holders will be able to visit their NFT location, there is a public access bridleway through the woodland, that non-NFT holders are welcome to use to visit the woodland.

The exact location will be revealed after purchase. It's beautiful protected old growth broadleaf, in an area of natural beauty just outside the M25.

# Why should i buy into the presale?

NFTs minted during the pre-sale will be around 50/Eth. Once you receive your NFTs you're welcome to sell them on any platform that supports EIP 721 or 1155(tbc) (opensea for example). After the pre-sale, presale participants are free to keep their NFTs or sell them or transfer them on any platfrorm and for any consideration or prices they like.

If we're unable to raise 100 ETH, or unable to proceed for any reason, we'll return ETH to the sender address minus any ETH gas fees. _*DO NOT SEND FUNDS FROM AN EXCHANGE! You will not receive your funds back, or your NFTs if you do.*_

# What will the NFTs be worth?

We plan on minting 5000 NFTs/100 ETH, at current ETH prices, we would therefore expect each NFT to cost roughly Â£30 each to mint (including some gas fees). If they are sold for more than that by presale participants, then presale participants will make a profit.

# Can i help create the NFTs?

Yes, we'd love volunteers to come and help us take 5k photos. We'll provide a special camera app that attaches GPS coordinates to the image as it's taken.

# How will NFTs be allocated?

NFTs will be randomly distributed to pre-sale participants. 

Naming rights for the woodland will pass to the holder of the most NFTs at the end of the pre-sale, and will be represented by an NFT, that will have the right to rename the woodland without requiring a DAO vote. 

Some NFTs will be rarer than others. There are, for example, several beautiful old grow oak trees, that we expect will be extremely valuable as NFTs. These like all other NFTs will be randomly distributed at the end of the presale.

# Who will own the woodland?

Within 12 months, we will setup a Community Interest Company ( https://www.gov.uk/set-up-a-social-enterprise ) and transfer any unspent ETH, assets (treedao.eth and treedao.org) and ownership of the woodland.

# What is the DAO?

A DAO is an Distributed Autonomous Organization. For TreeDAO, this means that anyone who owns 1 NFT, gets 1 vote in how the woodland is run. The DAO code will be built after the NFT lauches, so even if you don't care about the voting rights, you can particiapte in the pre-sale, or buy NFTs as gifts. 

The DAO will have an Articles of Association, that will also become the Articles for the Community Interest Corp that actually owns the woodland. In addition we'll have a negative feedback mechanism. To propose a Resolution, you must stake 1 NFT. The resolution passes if quorum is reached and more than 50% of votes are in favour. If quorum is not reached your NFT will be returned to you. If quorum is reached, and your resolution is rejected, your NFT will be burned.

One thing the DAO may vote on, is creating more NFTs, raising more ETH, or buying additional woodlands.

# How are you making money from this?

I (Simon Vans-Colina) am participating in the pre-sale. I will to sell a portion of my randomly allocated NFTs, and will retain a portion.

I am receiving no other compensation for this project. 

1 amazing developer who wishes to remain anonymous, will receive 1% of the minted NFT as payment for building the presale site and NFT contract and a further 1% will be reserved for paying for the development of the DAO contract and associated website.
