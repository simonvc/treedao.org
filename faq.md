# Why an NFT + DAO?

# Where is the woodland?

We are currently looking at a property just north of london, a short distance from the tube line. NFT holders will be able to visit their NFT location, there is a public access bridleway through the woodland, that non-holders are welcome to use to visit the woodland.

# Why should i buy into the presale?

NFTs minted during the pre-sale will be around 50/Eth. Once you receive your NFTs you're welcome to sell them on any platform that supports EIP 721 (opensea for example). They may well sell for a premium, meaning you'll make a profit.

# What will the NFTs be worth?

We plan on minting 5000 NFTs/100 ETH, at current ETH prices, we would therefore expect each NFT to cost roughly Â£50 each to mint (including some gas fees). If they are sold for more than that by presale participants, then presale participants will make a profit.

# Can i help create the NFTs?

Yes, we'd love volunteers to come and help us take 5k photos. We'll provide a special camera app that attaches GPS coordinates to the image as it's taken.

# Who will own the woodland?

Within 12 months, we will setup a Community Interest Corporation and transfer any unused ETH, assets (treedao.eth and treedao.org) and ownership of the woodland.

# What is the DAO?

A DAO is an Distributed Autonomous Organization. For TreeDAO, this means that anyone who owns 1 NFT, gets 1 vote in how the woodland is run. The DAO code will be built after the NFT lauches, so even if you don't care about the voting rights, you can particiapte in the pre-sale, or buy NFTs as gifts. 

The DAO will have an Articles of Association, that will also become the Articles for the Community Interest Corp that actually owns the woodland. In addition we'll have a negative feedback mechanism. To propose a Resolution, you must stake 1 NFT. The resolution passes if quorum is reached and more than 50% of votes are in favour. If quorum is not reached your NFT will be returned to you. If quorum is reached, and your resolution is rejected, your NFT will be burned.

One thing the DAO may vote on, is creating more NFTs, raising more ETH, or buying additional woodlands.
